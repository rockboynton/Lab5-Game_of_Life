# Lab5-Game_of_Life
The Game of Life was proposed in 1970 as a simple, 0-player game based on a grid of “cells.” The cells can only be alive or dead and cannot interact outside of their neighborhood. Cells have rules that define whether they live or die based on whether their neighbors are alive or dead. In general, if several neighbors are alive, then a cell will die due to starvation, and if there are not enough neighbors, a cell will die due to loneliness. A cell can become alive if the right number of cells are alive around it (if the right community exists). The basic idea of the game is to explore issues of population dynamics.
